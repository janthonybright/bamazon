# Bamazon
In this project I built an app Akin to a Amazon store. Using Node, mySQL, and inquirer users have a choice of mutiple options that they can select. When they choose their desired item by ID, they then choose the quantity and the app will calculate their total price. If the database does not have contain the quantity the user selected the app will notify and reset the store program.
